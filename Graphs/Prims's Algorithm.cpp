/*
Its basically brute Force:
it picks up the node (out if all the currently presetn nodes in  the minimum spanning tree) with smallest weight and adds to it
thus increasing the size of MST by one,
at the point MST contains all the nodes of the graph the algo then ends

Step-wise Explanation:
1. Figure out, which is the node with minimum weight attached to it
2. Mark it with true
3.
